## Wind Energy 

Wind energy is a crucial element in the global strategy to combat climate change. It has become a significant sector in the renewable energy landscape, but its growth has not been rapid enough to meet the climate change targets. The wind energy sector faces challenges in terms of cost, reliability, efficiency, and more recently, recyclability. One of the most expensive components of wind turbines, the blades, are also the most difficult to recycle.

Recyclable wind turbines can help reduce costs by enabling the reuse of expensive materials while minimizing waste. This will make wind energy more competitive in the renewable energy space. Currently, wind turbine blades often end up in landfills due to the difficulty in recycling them. This is ironic given that wind turbines are a symbol of sustainability and green energy.

This project aims to tackle the recyclability of wind blades by developing a machine learning model to analyze the characteristics of current renewable, recyclable composite materials and compare their properties to traditional materials like epoxy and fiberglass. By analyzing the results from current materials, the model will predict which characteristics are most important for recyclable materials.

The project will utilize two datasets: the OptiDAT dataset and the SNL/DOE/MSU dataset, both containing material properties of wind turbine blades. These datasets will be used to train the machine learning model to predict the most important characteristics of recyclable materials. By identifying and predicting these features, the model will help researchers and engineers develop new materials more efficiently.

There is a pressing need for new technologies and innovations to address the challenges in wind energy and make it more competitive in the renewable energy space. By focusing on recyclability and efficiency, wind energy can continue to play a pivotal role in mitigating climate change and contributing to a sustainable future. This project aims to contribute to this effort by providing insights into the development of recyclable wind turbine blades.
